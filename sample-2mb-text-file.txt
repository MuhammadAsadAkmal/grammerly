sufficiently popular to haveg attained to somel standard pronunciation,  how.  much  more  it  is  sc>wit:h  words  such 
as  ace  famine,  which  have  no  popular  currency,  and  which  indeed  were  ma'&^pet  primarily^  tÂ»2b^  sj5okeji  but

no  thought  was  given  by  their  makers?  On  several  occasions,  the  Editor  has  app  fifed  directly  to  the 
introducer  of  a  word,  to  know  how  he  pronounces  it,  or  means  it  to  be  pronounced,  and  has  rectfttd  the 
answer,  that  he  has  never  thought  of  its  pronunciation,  does  not  presume  to  say  how  it  ought  to  be  pro- 
nounced, and  leaves  it  to  people  to  pronounce  as  they  like,  or  to  the  DICTIONARY  to  say  what  is  the  right 
pronunciation.  This,  of  course,  reverses  the  natural  order  of  language,  in  which  speech  comes  first,  and  writing 
is  only  its  symbolization  ;  for  here  the  first  thing  is  the  written  symbol  addressed  to  the  eye  (and  reminding 
the  reader  perhaps  more  or  less  distinctly  of  other  written  symbols  which  are  to  be  found  in  the  Greek 
Lexicon),  while,  for  'pronunciation',  anything  passes  muster  which  suffices  to  recall  the  written  symbol  in 
question  ;  just  as  any  reading  of  a  mathematical  formula  passes  muster,  if  it  enables  an  auditor  to  write  down 
the  formula  again.  In  dealing  with  words  in  which  two  or  more  pronunciations  are  current,  these  pronuncia- 
tions are  given  in  the  Dictionary  ;  in  thet  case  of  those  in  which  no  standard  exists,  an  attempt  has  been 
made  to  follow  analogies  so  far  as  they  go,  and  at  least  to  mark  the  place  of  the  stress  ;  but  sometimes  it  has 
not  been  possible  to  do  even  this.
